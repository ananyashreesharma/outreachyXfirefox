# MY OUTREACHY BLOG

Welcome! This is my personal outreachy blog that documents my journey with Outreachy and Mozilla Firefox.

## Introduce Yourself {#introduce-yourself}

*December 07, 2024*



> Hi, I'm Ananya (pronounced uh-NUN-yah).

### WHO I AM

What drives me:
- Working on things that are like **real impactful products**
- The intersection where **tech and art meet**
- Thinking about **UX, feelings, and tiny details** while understanding **how everything is wired underneath**

That mix is what pulled me towards FOSS and to Outreachy and Firefox.

### WHY OUTREACHY

The moment I read about Outreachy, it felt like home. Someone was quietly saying, **"you belong here"** and that feeling alone was enough to:
- Show up
- Apply
- Keep going through all the stages

The contribution period was really kind and encouraging and I liked getting a hold of Swift and UI Kit while also simultaneously making contributions

In an environment like that, it's easy to imagine yourself contributing for a long time without burning out on doubt.

### WHY FIREFOX

Before Outreachy, I was already experimenting with mobile dev. Firefox felt like a perfect match.

It feels like I've found a new ocean and I just want to keep swimming deeper into it.

Through this internship, I'm hoping to:
- Learn a lot more about how impactful apps are designed and shipped
- Find a community of like-minded people who care about users, openness, and good products

### THIS BLOG

This blog is my small space to document that journey. Nothing fancy, just honest check-ins as I learn, build, and grow.
