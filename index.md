# MY OUTREACHY BLOG

Welcome! This is my personal outreachy blog that documents my journey with Outreachy and Mozilla Firefox.

## Introduction {#introduce-yourself}

*December 07, 2024*

> Hi, I'm Anannya (pronounced uh-NUN-yah).

### WHO I AM

What drives me:
- Working on **real impactful products**
- The intersection where **tech and art meet**
- Thinking about **UX, feelings, and tiny details** while understanding **how everything is wired underneath**

That mix pulled me towards FOSS, [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), and Firefox.

### WHY OUTREACHY

Reading about [Outreachy's](https://www.outreachy.org/) program description gave me that **"you belong here"** feeling. That was enough to show up, apply, and keep going through all the stages. 

During the contribution period, I got hands on with Swift and UI Kit while making actual contributions. My mentors were available, patient, and genuinely helpful. In an environment like that, it's easy to see yourself contributing long term without burning out.

### WHY FIREFOX

I was already experimenting with mobile dev before Outreachy. Firefox felt like a perfect match.

Through this internship with [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), I'm hoping to:
- Learn how impactful apps are designed and shipped
- Find a community of like-minded people

**What I'll be working on:**

My project focuses on Firefox's native error pages. When I explored the codebase, I found there's a "no internet connection" error page with a cute fox illustration that was disabled. I enabled it and tested it locally. Other errors still fall back to older HTML-based pages with technical wording that can be confusing.

My task is to expand those native error pages to cover common error types. I'll be collaborating with UX and PM teams on clearer designs and their implementation.

**What I've been preparing before the official start:**

- Swift, UIKit and Redux-style state management
- The native error page codebase
- How the existing "no internet" implementation works
- How other browsers (Safari, Chrome, Brave) handle their error pages
