# MY OUTREACHY BLOG

Welcome! This is my personal outreachy blog.

## Introduce Yourself {#introduce-yourself}

*December 07, 2024*

> Hi, I'm Ananya (pronounced uh-NUN-yah).

### WHO I AM

I really like working on things that feel like actual products, not just pretty code that lives in a folder somewhere. I'm happiest where art and tech meet, thinking about UX, feelings, and tiny details, but also about how everything is wired underneath. That mix is what pulled me towards FOSS and to Outreachy and Firefox.

### WHY OUTREACHY

Outreachy honestly felt like home from the moment I read about it. It was like someone quietly saying, "you belong here" and even just that feeling was enough for me to show up, apply, and keep going through all the stages. The contribution period itself was really kind and encouraging. My mentors were available, patient, and genuinely helpful, and that made such a big difference. In an environment like that, it's easy to imagine yourself contributing for a long time without burning out on doubt.

### WHY FIREFOX

Before that time, I was experimenting with mobile dev already, and Firefox felt like a perfect match. It feels like I've found a new ocean and I just want to keep swimming deeper into it. Through this internship, I'm hoping to learn a lot more about how impactful apps are designed and shipped, and to find a community of like-minded people who care about users, openness, and good products.

### THIS BLOG

This blog is my small space to document that journey, nothing fancy, just honest check-ins as I learn, build, and grow.
