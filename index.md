# MY OUTREACHY BLOG

Welcome! This is my personal outreachy blog that documents my journey with Outreachy and Mozilla Firefox.

## Introduce Yourself {#introduce-yourself}

*December 07, 2024*



> Hi, I'm Ananya (pronounced uh-NUN-yah).

### WHO I AM

What drives me:
- Working on **real impactful products**
- The intersection where **tech and art meet**
- Thinking about **UX, feelings, and tiny details** while understanding **how everything is wired underneath**

That mix pulled me towards FOSS, [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), and Firefox.

### WHY OUTREACHY

Reading about [Outreachy's](https://www.outreachy.org/) program description gave me that **"you belong here"** feeling. That was enough to show up, apply, and keep going through all the stages. 

During the contribution period, I got hands-on with Swift and UI Kit while making contributions. My mentors were available, patient, and genuinely helpful. In an environment like that, it's easy to see yourself contributing long term without burning out.

### WHY FIREFOX

I was already experimenting with mobile dev before Outreachy. Firefox felt like a perfect match. Through this internship with [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), I'm hoping to:
- Learn how impactful apps are designed and shipped
- Find a community of like-minded people 

### THIS BLOG

This blog documents that journey. Nothing fancy, just honest check-ins as I learn, build, and grow.
